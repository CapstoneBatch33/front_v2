Things That Are NOT Fully Implemented:
1. Real Hardware Integration
  Missing: getting the real sensor values to the esp32
2. AI Load Balancer Backend
  Missing: The actual Python gRPC server for load balancing
  Missing: load_balancer.proto file for gRPC definitions
  Missing: grpc_bridge.py script referenced in API routes
  Status: API routes exist but will fail without the Python backend
  Impact: Load balancer testing page won't work with real distributed AI
3. Plant Disease Detection Model
  Missing: Actual TensorFlow.js model files (/models/plant_disease_model/model.json)
  Status: Model loading code exists but model files are missing
  Impact: Image upload for disease detection will fail
4. Database Integration
  Current: Uses simple JSON file storage
  Missing: Proper database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
  Impact: Limited scalability and data persistence
5. Authentication & Security
  Missing: User authentication system
  Missing: API security/rate limiting
  Missing: Role-based access control
  Impact: System is completely open
6. Real-time Data Streaming
  Missing: WebSocket connections for live updates
  Current: Uses polling every 10 seconds
  Impact: Not truly real-time
7. Production Configuration
  Missing: Docker containerization
  Missing: Environment-specific configs
  Missing: CI/CD pipeline
  Missing: Monitoring and logging setup
8. API Endpoints Not Implemented
  /api/sensor-data - Returns mock data instead of real Pi data
  /api/assistant - AI assistant endpoint missing
  Most gRPC endpoints will fail without Python backend
9. Error Handling & Validation
  Incomplete: Limited input validation
  Missing: Comprehensive error boundaries
  Missing: Proper API error responses
10. Testing
  Missing: Unit tests
  Missing: Integration tests
  Missing: E2E tests
